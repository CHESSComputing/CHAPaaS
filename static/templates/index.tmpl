            was designed to simlify user analysis and follow
            base practices to design, maintain and distriburte

            The <a href="https://github.com/CHESSComputing/ChessAnalysisPipeline">CHAP</a>
            is Python based framework to provide plugable components
            to execute analysis pipeline. It can run on a command line
            or via CHAP as a Service web based framework. It is integrated
            with <a href="https://galaxyproject.org">Galaxy Science gateway</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            CHAP as a service provides easy way to write, maintain, version,
            publish user workflows, and make it
