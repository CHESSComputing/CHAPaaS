            To get started with CHAPBook, you can modify an existing
            <a href="{{.Base}}/workflows">
                Workflow
            </a>
            or create a new

                Notebook
            </a>
	    from scratch.
            Then, select your input data and output file locations, and
	    simply type in an
            algorithm to process your data.<!-- CHAPBook will take care of the
	    rest: code versioning,
            packaging, debugging, profiling and integrating with
            Galaxy science gateway. -->

            <h1>CHAPBook</h1>
            is a web-based service that provides an easy way to build
	    data processing workflows in the
            <a href="https://github.com/CHESSComputing/ChessAnalysisPipeline">CHESS Analysis Pipeline (CHAP)</a>
	    framework. It allows researchers to develop, test, run,
	    maintain, and distribute Python algorithms via a
            user-friendly interface that hides the complexity of the CHESS
	    computing environment.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <a href="https://github.com/CHESSComputing/ChessAnalysisPipeline">CHAP</a>
	    workflows are assembled from re-usable Python modules.
	    In a complete workflow, modules that handle common logistical
	    functions, like data I/O and metadata retrieval,
	    are attached to other modules that perform algorithmic data
	    manipulations.

	    Using CHAPBook, users can create an entire CHAP workflow simply
	    by writing the code for their algorithm. CHAPBook will then
	    validate that code, submit it to a repository for version
	    control, and insert it into a CHAP template.

	    CHAPBook also helps users disseminate their research materials
	    according to <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/findable-accessible-interoperable-reusable-open">FAIR principles</a>.
	    Using CHAPBookâ€™s suite of publishing utilities, researchers can
	    assign digital object identifiers to their workflows, deposit
	    them in a
            <a href="https://galaxyproject.org">Galaxy Science gateway</a>,
	    and make them available for use by the scientific community.
            <br/>
            <br/>
	    With its powerful combination of capabilities, CHAPBook is not
	    just a computational tool. It is also an instrument of open
	    science.
